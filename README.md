# Car Rental Web Application

This Laravel-based Car Rental Web Application allows users to browse available cars, select a car, and book it for a specified rental period. The system ensures that cars are available for the chosen dates before confirming the booking. The application features role-based access control, an admin dashboard, and a frontend for user interaction.

## Features

### Admin Dashboard
Administrators can:
- **Manage Cars**: Add, edit, and delete car details, including name, brand, model, year of manufacture, car type (SUV, Sedan, etc.), daily rent price, availability status, and car images.
- **Manage Rentals**: View and manage all car rentals, including rental ID, customer name, car details, rental start and end dates, total cost, and rental status (Ongoing, Completed, Canceled).
- **Manage Customers**: View and manage customer details such as name, email, phone number, address, and rental history.
- **Dashboard Overview**: View important statistics, such as the total number of cars, available cars, total rentals, and earnings from rentals.

### Frontend (User Interface)
Users can:
- **Browse Cars**: View available cars with filters such as car type, brand, and daily rent price.
- **Make a Booking**: Select a car, choose the rental start and end date, and book the car (availability is checked).
- **Manage Bookings**: After logging in, users can view their current and past bookings and cancel a booking (only if the rental has not started yet).
- **User Authentication**: Basic authentication system allowing users to sign up, log in, and log out.

### Email Notifications
- When a car is rented, the customer and admin receive a confirmation email with the rental details.

### Payment System
- No payment system is implemented, as bookings are handled by cash.

## Database Design

The database consists of the following tables:

- **users**: Stores information about users (both customers and admins).
  - `id`, `name`, `email`, `password`, `role`, `created_at`, `updated_at`
  
- **cars**: Stores details about cars.
  - `id`, `name`, `brand`, `model`, `year`, `car_type`, `daily_rent_price`, `availability`, `image`, `created_at`, `updated_at`
  
- **rentals**: Stores information about rentals.
  - `id`, `user_id`, `car_id`, `start_date`, `end_date`, `total_cost`, `created_at`, `updated_at`
